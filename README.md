# Butterfly Guesthouse Booking (BFGbooking)

BFGbooking is a simple terminal*based python application to search for guest bookings at Butterfly Guesthouse.

The application is connected to a google spreadsheet that is populated by guests filling in the booking form on the Butterfly Guesthouse website.

## Features

* Welcome and Prompt
    * The app opens to a welcome message and a prompt requesting the user to input the name of the guest they wish to search for.
    * This is vry straightforward and clearly directs the user on what to do, even prompting them how to exit if they wish to do.

* Wrong Entry
    * If the entry isn't found in the directory the user is alerted and promted to try again.
    * Again, this is very straight forward. No name other than the exact one the room has been booked with will be accepted.

* Guest Found
    * When a guest is found all information they input into the webpage form is called up.
    * As is expected when a matching name is inputted the relevant information for the guest is delivered to the user to confirm the details of the booking.

## Testing
I manually tested the project using the following methods:

* Tested python code through a PEP8 Linter and fixed any errors. The website pep8online.com was down at the time of testing, so as a workaround, I addeda PEP8 validator to my Gitpod Workspace directly by following these steps:
    * Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle  Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.
    * In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
    * Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results.
    * Select pycodestyle from the list.
    * PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

## Validation
* PEP8
Only 1 Error "line too long (90 > 79 characters)" left as I felt this was okay to ignore for the sake of the line's presentation on the terminal.

## Deployment
